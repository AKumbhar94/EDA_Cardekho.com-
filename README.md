# EDA on CarDekho

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the CarDekho dataset, which contains information on used cars. The goal of the analysis is to derive insights and understand key factors that influence car prices and how various features correlate with each other.

The CarDekho dataset includes attributes like car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and selling price. This project will guide you through the cleaning, visualization, and exploration of the dataset, helping to extract meaningful insights.
